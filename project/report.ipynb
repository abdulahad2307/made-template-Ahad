    "# 1. Introducation:\n",
    "The Paphos International Airport plays a crucial role in connecting Cyprus to the global network of air travel. As a vital transportation hub, it is essential to understand how daily air traffic at this airport is influenced by weather conditions. This data science project focuses on analyzing the relationship between weather patterns and air traffic to provide valuable insights for airlines, passengers, and decision-makers. By examining these factors, we aim to help stakeholders better plan and manage their operations, ultimately benefiting Cyprus's economy and promoting efficient and safe air travel.\n",

    "Now, the question that interests us is: How do the weather conditions in Paphos International Airport impact air traffic throughout the year? And we will try to answer this question by focusing on several short questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the air traffic volume at Paphos International Airport vary throughout the year?\n",
    "2. How does the wind speed at Paphos International Airport vary throughout the year?\n",
    "3. Does wind speed affect air traffic volume at Paphos International Airport?\n",
    "4. How does the wind direction at Paphos International Airport vary throughout the year?\n",
    "5. Does wind direction affect air traffic volume at Paphos International Airport?\n",
    "6. How does the temperature at Paphos International Airport vary throughout the year?\n",
    "7. Does temperature affect air traffic volume at Paphos International Airport?\n",
    "8. Is there any relation between the average sea-level air pressure on the total air traffic at Paphos International Airport?\n",
